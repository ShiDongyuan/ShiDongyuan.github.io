Smart Noise Migitagion Technique in Singapore
======
The effects of urban heat islands (UHI) and noise pollution, particularly in dense cities, on human health are beginning to emerge. In Singapore, air-conditioners and sound barriers are often selected as a solution to fight off the heat and noise. Ironically, air-conditioners are one of the identified causes of UHI in Singapore, as reported by the Urban Redevelopment
Authority. In contrast, the sound barriers are costly to build and yet aesthetically unpleasant
with limited effectiveness. Moreover, noise travels in waves, not straight lines, and hence, it
can go over obstacles. Therefore, even with barriers standing more than 5 meters, homes
several blocks away still hear the noise. Also, several studies have highlighted the importance
of adequate fresh air ventilation on human health, especially in the current Covid-19
pandemic, where the current study has shown that proper ventilation help in preventing the
transmission of Covid-19. Therefore, in this presentation, we will bring in the active noise
control (ANC) technique, which depends solely on the loudspeaker producing an anti-noise
wave to cancel out unwanted noise. It can be installed and used in many areas owing to its
compact size. For instance, the usual window combined with the ANC system can suppress
ambient noises in high-density cities, such as traffic noise, train noise, and so on, without
affecting natural ventilation. To cope with city machinery noise, we have developed a
transportable ANC module to combat machinery noise. It can be positioned around noise
sources, such as generators, transformers, and large construction equipment, to minimize
their mechanical noise without interfering with their operation. Finally, we will provide an
outlook on several breakthrough deep-learning technologies utilized in the field of ANC
further to improve its performance in more complex acoustic situations.
