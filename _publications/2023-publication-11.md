excerpt: 'Active noise control (ANC) has been widely utilized to reduce unwanted environmental noise. The primary objective of ANC is to generate an anti-noise with the same amplitude but the opposite phase of the primary noise using the secondary source. However, the effectiveness of the ANC application is impacted by the speakerâ€™s output saturation. This paper proposes a two-gradient direction ANC algorithm with a momentum factor to solve the saturation with faster convergence. In order to make it implemented in real-time, a computation-effective variable step size approach is applied to further reduce the steady-state error brought on by the changing gradient directions. The time constant and step size bound for the momentum two-gradient direction algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in the time-unvaried and time-varied environment.'
