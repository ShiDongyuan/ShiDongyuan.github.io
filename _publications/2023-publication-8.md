excerpt: 'Practical active noise control (ANC) systems, like the active noise cancellation headphone, usually adopt a control filter with preset coefficients to achieve satisfactory noise reduction performance for dynamic noise and higher robustness. In this strategy, selecting the appropriate control filter for different types of noise is critical to the noise cancellation performance, and this selection mechanism is typically determined by trial and error. Hence, this article proposes a computation-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network capable of selecting the most suitable pre-trained control filter for each distinct primary noise. Applying the similarity matching method allows the proposed model to have a better generalization and can even deal with zero-shot noise, whose class does not exist in the training set. The Large-margin softmax (L-softmax) is also investigated to improve the proposed model's performance'
