excerpt: 'Delayless noise control is achieved by our earlier generative fixed-filter active noise control (GFANC) framework through efficient coordination between the co-processor and real-time controller. However, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) in the co-processor requires initial training using labelled noise datasets. Labelling noise data can be resource-intensive and may introduce some biases. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised-GFANC approach to simplify the 1D CNN training process and enhance its practicality. During training, the co-processor and real-time controller are integrated into an end-to-end differentiable ANC system. This enables us to use the accumulated squared error signal as the loss for training the 1D CNN. With this unsupervised learning paradigm, the unsupervised-GFANC method not only omits the labelling process but also exhibits better noise reduction ...'
