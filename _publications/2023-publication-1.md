excerpt: 'The selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method can select suitable pre-trained control filters to attenuate incoming noises. However, the limited number of pre-trained filters is insufficient to effectively control various forms of noise, especially when the incoming noise differs much from the filter-training noises. To address this limitation and generate more appropriate control filters, a generative fixed-filter active noise control approach based on Bayesian filter (GFANC-Bayes) is proposed in this paper. The GFANC-Bayes method can automatically generate suitable control filters by combining sub control filters. The combination weights of sub control filters are predicted via a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN). Based on prior information and predicted information, Bayesian filtering technique is applied to decide the combination weights. By considering the correlation between ...'
