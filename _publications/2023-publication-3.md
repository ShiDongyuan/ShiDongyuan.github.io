excerpt: 'Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control (SFANC) is limited by its selection of a single candidate from pre-trained control filters. In contrast, Generative Fixed-filter Active Noise Control (GFANC) addresses this limitation by employing an adaptive combination of sub control filters to generate more suitable control filters for different primary noises. However, GFANC solely relies on the information from the current noise frame to generate its control filter, resulting in potential inaccuracies when dealing with dynamic noises. Therefore, we propose a GFANC-Kalman approach that integrates an efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) with a Kalman filter to further improve the performance of GFANC. Specifically, the weight vector used to combine sub control filters is predicted by the 1D CNN for each noise frame, and then processed by the Kalman filter with minimal complexity. By considering the ...'
