excerpt: 'Due to their computational efficiency, least mean square (LMS)–based algorithms are still widely utilized to achieve optimal control in active noise control (ANC) applications. Real-world implementation of advanced ANC functionalities, such as selective cancellation of frequencies, is nonetheless hampered by complexity trade-offs, especially with computationally-expensive frequency-domain approaches. Prevailing time-domain adaptive algorithms – proposed to alleviate complexities from transformation – continue to incur increased complexities while constraining the magnitude of frequency bins in the time-domain filters. To address existing complexities in time-domain approaches, this paper proposes a circulant convolutional penalty factor that assists the extended leaky filtered-reference LMS (FxLMS) algorithm in achieving frequency constraint without any frequency-domain transform. This circulant ...'
